# Multiple Tabs Using Vanilla JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to create a multiple tabs interface using vanilla JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

`git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/multiple-tabs.git`
cd multiple-tabs
open index.html`

## How it Works

The `index.html file` contains the basic HTML structure of the tabs interface. The `css/index.css` file contains the styles for the interface, and the `js/index.js` file contains the JavaScript code that makes the tabs interactive.

The JavaScript code works by selecting all the `nav` and `.content` elements on the page, and then attaching click event listeners to each `li` element in the nav element. When a `li` element is clicked, the JavaScript code removes the `active` class from all the `li` elements in the nav element, and then adds the active class to the clicked li element. It also shows the corresponding `content` element in the .content element by adding the `content-active` class to the corresponding element.
